"Can you please make a video on how non technical students specially those who have done Bachelors in Business Administration can prepare for Data Science?  More videos are required on this topic too because people only talk about how people from tech background can be data scientist, they don't talk much about how people from other background can even be.",0
"Hi, need your suggestion regarding IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera. Is it enough to do to get a good job? OR which one(s) you suggest to do on Coursera???",0
You're the best guidence one can find about Data science on Youtube ... ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥,0
"This is awesome! Iâ€™m starting out as an Software Engineer and I am very interested in Data Science. I just started a MS in CS with Machine Learning. I do have one question, can you elaborate on what it is to write your own model?

Thank you for the awesome videos!",0
ðŸ’… great content!,0
"Hey, Thank you so much for talking about this. I didnâ€™t knew that there is job role which I just dreamt of to have. But now it gave me more motivation to study data science along with my CS degree. Thanks again.",1
That's amazing! I am so glad you got to watch this video :),0
Hello. Thank you for putting your time for us to know more about the field. I am from biochemistry backgoround and want to start data science. I have 8 year of experience in core and clinical science. What would you reccoment how to start and should i go on this path. Your response is appreciated.,0
"You already have an awesome in clinical science. I would say focu on figuring out which job family with data science you want to target and then create a plan. Also, watch ""How I would Learn Data Science"" video on my page, where I share a framework.",0
I do not have an undergraduate computer science degree would I need a computer science masters or data science master to become  an applied data scientist,1
@Michael Robinson SDE stands for Software Development Engineer.,0
@Sundas Khalid What is SDE,0
"to be honest, it completely depends on the DS masters curriculum. Depending on how technical it is, it might be all you need. If you can pass an SDE I bar after that program, then that's a good sign.",0
"Thank you for this. Please also make video on role ""Machine Learning Scientist""",4
Thank you for the suggestion. I will add it to my idea list.,1
Thank you Sundas. You are amazing. Keep adding more,0
Thank you for watching! I appreciate the encouragement.,0
"I thought ML engineers need computer science + data science skills, and Applied Scientist need data science + very good math skills and research background",3
"Actually if you read the job description of an applied scientist, most mention computer science degree as requirement.",1
